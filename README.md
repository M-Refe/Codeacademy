I created this repo, started with Supermarket code.
I've realized that codeacademy syntax is a little different from Visual code/ real syntax. 
I have to figure out the equivalent in real life vs on codeacademy.

**print requires () around the statement instead of empty on codeacademy**

$ rm -rf .git/index.lock

when using git commit -a, i had issues with the repository locking, used above code to remove locked index so that i could commit changes/push origin main
