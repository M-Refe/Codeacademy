#while loop is similar to an if statement
#while loop will continue to execute as long as the condition is true

#it executes whil that thing is true

count = 0

if count < 5:
  print ("Hello, I am an if statement and count is"), count

while count <= 9:
  print ("Hello, I am a while and count is"), count
  count += 1

#the while loop above will print out the statement until the count goes to number 10, and then it will completely stop looping

#Loop condition
# condition is the expression that decides whether the loop is going to continue being exececuted or not
# 5 steps
    #loop_condition variable is set to True
    #the while loop checks to see if loop_condition is True.  It is, so the loop is entered
    #the print statement is executed
    #the variable loop_condition is set to False
    #The while loop again checks to see if loop_condition is True.
