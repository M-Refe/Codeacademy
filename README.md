# Codeacademy
Projects created from Codeacademy

All projects in repo are from codeacademy, I have started with learning Python and practiced what was on the website into "real life"

Started this journey on 6/13/2022.

I created this repo, started with Supermarket code.
I've realized that codeacademy syntax is a little different from Visual code/ real syntax. 
I have to figure out the equivalent in real life vs on codeacademy.

**print requires () around the statement instead of empty on codeacademy**
